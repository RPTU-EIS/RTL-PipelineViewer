✅ FUNCTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS
1. Color-Code Instructions by Type
Green for arithmetic/logical (e.g., add, sub)

Blue for memory operations (lw, sw)

Orange for branches (beq, bne)

Red for jumps (jal, jalr)

🔧 Implementation: Add a simple opcode_type extractor using the disassembly and map it to a color in the HTML cell background.

2. Timeline Bar / Gantt-Style View
Display a horizontal bar per instruction across cycles instead of matrix.

Shows instruction lifespan clearly (fetch → writeback).

Easy to spot hazards visually.

📚 Especially useful for teaching or debugging pipeline stalls.

3. Highlight Stalls or Bubbles
Detect pipeline stalls (e.g., from repeated PCs or pipeline freezing).

Highlight those cells as gray or striped.

Add tooltip: "Pipeline Stall due to hazard".

4. Add Cycle Count Per Instruction
In a new column, display:

Total cycles the instruction spent in pipeline

Or time to completion

Could be useful for IPC (instructions per cycle) metrics or performance analysis.

📊 DATA INTEGRATION IDEAS
5. Display Register Writebacks
In WB stage, show which register was written to and with what value (if signal available).

Example tooltip:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Stage: WB
ASM: addi x1, x0, 42
→ x1 = 42
Use VCD signals like regFile.writeAddress and writeData if available.

6. Error Detection / Warnings
Warn when:

Instruction changes but PC doesn't.

Instruction decoded as unknown.

Pipeline stalls unexpectedly.

Add visual flags or export them into a log/CSV.

🧠 UX / EDUCATION IMPROVEMENTS
7. Search or Filter Instructions
Add textbox to search for:

Specific instruction (addi)

Specific PC (0x00000100)

Or register involved (x1)

Make your HTML interactive using JS (e.g., DataTables or a React frontend later).

8. Export to Animation
Export instruction execution as GIF/MP4, one frame per cycle.

Useful for presentation, education, or debugging without re-running everything.

🛠 DEVELOPMENT TOOLING IDEAS
9. Real-Time Updates (Live VCD Monitoring)
Instead of parsing post-simulation, integrate into simulator's live output.

Update pipeline view in real time as the simulation progresses.

Could be done via WebSocket, or periodically refresh from file.

10. ISA-Aware Extensions
Highlight invalid instructions (e.g., compressed if not supported).

Show exception conditions (e.g., illegal access, divide by zero).

Enrich tool with RISC-V ISA knowledge.

🚀 BONUS IDEA: Pipeline Replay Mode
Let the user step forward/backward cycle-by-cycle like a debugger.

Use ← and → keys.

Show how instructions shift in the pipeline in slow motion.
